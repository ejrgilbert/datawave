# DataWave Quickstart

### Purpose

* This quickstart is intended to speed up your development workflow by automating
the steps that you'd otherwise need to perform manually to configure, build, deploy, 
and test a standalone DataWave environment

* It includes setup and tear-down automation for DataWave, Hadoop, Accumulo,
ZooKeeper, etc, and provides convenience methods for testing DataWave's
ingest and query components

* For simplicity, all cluster services are downloaded/installed automatically,
they are extracted and installed under the quickstart home directory, and all
are owned/executed by the current user

* Docker alternative: rather than installing and running services locally, you may prefer
to run the entire [quickstart environment as a Docker container](docker/README.md). This will
provide the exact same capabilities described below, but hosted on a CentOS 7 base image.
