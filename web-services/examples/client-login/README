client-login example

This project contains an example timer bean, which is an unsecured client,
that once a minute calls the secured EJB UserOperationsBean to get the
effective user auths for either the server, or a proxied user if the
environment variables USER_DN and ISSUER_DN are defined.

In order to run this example, you must re-build and deploy the datawave ear
with this example included. This can be done by building at the top level
with both the examples profile and the client-login-example profile enabled
(e.g., -Pdev,examples,client-login-example).
